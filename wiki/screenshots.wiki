#summary Some screen-shots to show the various functions.

This page shows some screen-shots of the software in action.


This is the main screen after you visit the main site http://localhost:5080 after installation. The picture shows the expanded menu option after you click on the menu button on the bottom control bar.

This is the device settings control. You should select the "allow" and "remember" options before clicking on the close button. This allows Flash Player to use the camera and microphone for this application

This is a new room creation page. The name, email and picture are already populated. You can click on the visiting card or login card link to see your incomplete card. After you create a room, your cards are available for download.

The default room for testing is available at http://localhost:5080/kundansingh_99@yahoo.com, and shows my visiting card. You can click on "Enter this room" button to enter the room and see the media items available in that room.

Once your enter the default room, you see the two pre-loaded play list. The left play list has some of my favorite songs, which you can view after you click on the play button for that playlist.

In this screen, I closed the other play-list, and also joined the same room from another browser instance. You can see the other participant's video. You need to enable the camera button in the bottom control-bar to start your camera feed in this room.

This screen shows two participants in the call, in this case, from the same camera. The local video is mirrored. There is also a play-list playing as the third item in the room. This is an example of shared video viewing in the room.
