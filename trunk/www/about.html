<h2>About Internet Video City</h2>

<p>
The Internet Video City project aims at providing open source and free software to support enterprise
and consumer video conferencing using ubiquitous web based Flash Player platform. The motive of this
project is to provide tools and technologies to other developers and system engineers so that they can
easily incorporate the video communication feature in their service, software or enterprise infrastructure.
Hence, we use open and customizable architecture, open standards, and promote third party contributions.
This page describes the software and how it works.
</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

</ol>
</div>
</p><br/>

<h4>Architecture</h4>

<p>
The software consists of client and server. The server is written in the Python 2.5 programming language. 
The client is written in ActionScript 3.0 and runs in either Flash Player browser plugin of standalone 
Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR) platform. Similar to Python's motto, this software comes with batteries
included, and doesn't require external dependencies. In particular, it has built-in web and
media servers. 
</p>

<p>
The client viewer application controls the main display, shows local and remote videos, and provides
user friendly menu options. The client also captures and plays audio and video using the underlying
Flash Player plugin. The backend server controls the authentication, conference state and sharing of
media. In this client server architecture, multiple clients connect to the server hosting a conference.
The conference state may get distributed among multiple servers depending on the current load and
geography of the network.
</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>
If you are a developer and wants to get started with this software, I recommend that you checkout the 
sources from SVN, run the server and point your browser to http://localhost:5080
</p>

<p>
You may download the binary package, uncompress it, run the server and point your browser to the URL. 
The binary downloads tend to get outdated hence I would recommend using SVN even if you don't plan to
contribute to the project because in future you can use SVN to fetch the latest changes.

<!--
<h4>Misc</h4>

<p>
You can start the viewer in a kiosk mode so that it occupies the full screen giving a better view 
as a video software as follows. In most Windows XP installation, this can be done as follows.
<pre>"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" -k http://localhost:5080/embed/index.swf</pre>
